APIGEE RESPONSIVE THEME
=======================
The Apigee Responsive theme is designed to be used with Apigee Dev Portal. It
features a responsive theme so that your site looks good on computers and mobile
devices.

This theme is a subtheme of the bootstrap module
(https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) which is a theme that uses the
Twitter bootstrap project (http://getbootstrap.com/) that helps developers
quickly create nice looking websites that are mobile responsive.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
1. Bootstrap requires a minimum jQuery version of 1.7 to function properly.
   You must download and enable the jQuery Update module
   (http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update/), 7.x-2.3 version or higher.
   Navigate to the configuration page and ensure that the minimum version
   selected is 1.7.

SUBTHEMING
----------
While we tried to add as much functionality in the admin settings, you may want
to make more customizations to this theme using code.  Do not make any code
changes to this theme directly or you will not be able to update to the next
theme version.  Instead, you should subtheme this theme.

For general information on Drupal sub-themes, see:
https://www.drupal.org/node/225125

For instructions on how to sub-theme this theme please see:
1. The README.txt inside the apigee_responsive_starterkit directory in this
   theme.
2. The Apigee documentation at:
